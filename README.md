EarthPornWallpaper
==================
This is a program that will download the top rated post on reddit.com/r/earthporn and set it to your desktop backround.

Progress(Updated 12/1/14):
The program now works so that if you run it, it downloads the 5th post(I set it to that because while I was testing, posts 1-4 were not as pleasing to me) and sets it to your background. 

Goals:
Get it working:
    ---Downloads a specified image from r/earthporn--
    ---Sets that image to be the desktop background--
Check input:
    -There are several types of posts to r/earthporn, some links head directly to the image, some link to imgur, others link
      to flickr lightbox, etc. 
    -potential issues with file formats
    -rerouting to the next available picture if all else fails
    -avoid panoramas/take into account aspect ratios
Customizability:
    -the ability to choose how often the background updates
    -override the right click on the desktop's "next image" function to work with the application
Usability:
    -how to have different pictures when you have multiple monitors
      -maybe make multiple monitors work with panoramas
    -user interface
    -download more than one image for use offline
    -be able to download the image for personal use
    -have the program run on start as well as be always on to change the background when necessary
Rights:
    -Watermark based on what reddit user uploaded the image, in a subtle, but noticible place
    -Research usage rights for the image
