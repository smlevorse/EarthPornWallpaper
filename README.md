EarthPornWallpaper
==================
This is a program that will download the top rated post on reddit.com/r/earthporn and set it to your desktop backround.

<h2>Progress(Updated 12/2/14):</h2>
The program now works so that if you run it, it downloads the 5th post(I set it to that because while I was testing, posts 1-4 were not as pleasing to me) and sets it to your background. 

<h2>Goals:</h2>
Get it working:
<ul>
    <li>̶D̶o̶w̶n̶l̶o̶a̶d̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶c̶i̶f̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶m̶a̶g̶e̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶r̶/̶e̶a̶r̶t̶h̶p̶o̶r̶n̶</li>
    <li>̶S̶e̶t̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶i̶m̶a̶g̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶e̶s̶k̶t̶o̶p̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶g̶r̶o̶u̶n̶d̶</li>
</ul>
Check input:
<ul>
    <li>There are several types of posts to r/earthporn, some links head directly to the image, some link to imgur, others link to flickr lightbox, etc. </li>
    <li>̶P̶o̶t̶e̶n̶t̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶i̶s̶s̶u̶e̶s̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶ ̶f̶i̶l̶e̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶m̶a̶t̶s̶</li>
    <li>Rerouting to the next available picture if all else fails</li>
    <li>Avoid panoramas/take into account aspect ratios</li>
</ul>
Customizability:
<ul>
    <li>The ability to choose how often the background updates</li>
    <li>Override the right click on the desktop's "next image" function to work with the application</li>
</ul>
Usability:
<ul>
    <li>How to have different pictures when you have multiple monitors
      <ul><li>̶M̶a̶y̶b̶e̶ ̶m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶m̶u̶l̶t̶i̶p̶l̶e̶ ̶m̶o̶n̶i̶t̶o̶r̶s̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶ ̶p̶a̶n̶o̶r̶a̶m̶a̶s̶ Apparently this is automatic</li></ul></li>
    <li>User interface</li>
    <li>Download more than one image for use offline</li>
    <li>Be able to download the image for personal use</li>
    <li>Have the program run on start as well as be always on to change the background when necessary</li>
</ul>
Rights:
<ul>
    <li>Watermark based on what reddit user uploaded the image, in a subtle, but noticible place</li>
    <li>Research usage rights for the image</li>
</ul>
